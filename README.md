# Anthropometric Analysis: Gender Differences

This project focuses on analyzing anthropometric data to study physical measurement differences between males and females. The goal is to identify meaningful patterns in body proportions, weight, height, and related characteristics.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

* Processed and cleaned anthropometric data for accuracy.
* Created **new features** like Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist-to-Height Ratio, and Waist-to-Hip Ratio.
* Conducted **statistical analysis** such as correlation testing, z-score standardization, and outlier detection.
* Built **data visualizations** to highlight differences in measurements between genders.
* Compared body proportions, weight distribution, and height variations.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Libraries

* **Python**
* **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ data cleaning and analysis
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** â€“ data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ project development

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

* Differences in height, weight, and body proportions across genders.
* Correlation between body measurements and derived ratios.
* Outlier patterns in anthropometric data.
* Visualization of trends for better interpretation.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

* `Anthropometric_Analysis_Gender_Differences.ipynb` â€“ Main notebook with code, analysis, and visualizations.
* `README.md` â€“ Project documentation.

## âœ… Conclusion

This project helps in understanding gender-based differences in anthropometric data. The analysis and visualizations can be useful in fields like healthcare, fitness, and daily life applications
